## Description

Welcome to the Book Search Engine : Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data (In this case, a book search engine). The existing authentication middleware has been modified so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API, and an Apollo Provider has been created so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
